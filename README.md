# Emacs Haxe Tools
Collection of code to help with Haxe development on Emacs

# Introduction
I've been using Emacs as my environment for Haxe development for quite a while now and have made a number of convenience functions to help me with my work. 

This library should be considered as a collection of random tools that may or may not be helpful. Most of the functions here were added because I myself need them in my work so do not expect this to be comprehensive. 

## Functions
Function | Use 
---------|----
`haxe-tools-get-current-buffer-package-name` | Gets the package of the current haxe-mode buffer. This is the line usually on the top of the page preceded by "package"
`haxe-get-package-of-current-buffer-to-clipboard` | Gets the package of the current haxe-mode buffer and then puts it into the clipboard.
More to be added! |
